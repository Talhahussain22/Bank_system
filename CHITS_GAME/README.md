This Python project simulates a game where players compete to accumulate the highest total score by making strategic guesses. The game involves two levels: the upper class, where players can earn high scores, and the lower class, where they risk getting a low score.

Players take turns guessing who among the lower-scoring players is the "thief" (chor). If a player guesses correctly, they swap scores with the thief. The game continues until a player reaches a specified score limit, at which point the player with the highest score wins.

The project showcases the use of randomization, data manipulation, and decision-making logic in Python. It provides an interactive and engaging game experience, suitable for learning and entertainment purpose
