This project demonstrates the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python through a simple banking system. It includes two classes: User and Bank, where Bank is a subclass of User.

The User class represents a basic user profile with attributes like name, ID, password, and email. The showDetails method is used to display user information.

The Bank class inherits from the User class and includes additional functionality for banking operations. It adds a Balance attribute to track the user's account balance. The Deposit method allows users to deposit money into their account, while the Withdraw method allows them to withdraw money, with appropriate checks for sufficient balance.

The project aims to illustrate how OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding can be applied in real-world scenarios
